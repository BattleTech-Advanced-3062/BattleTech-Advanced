# Heraldry Picker

This small BattleTech mod improves the Company Customization screen with two features:

1. **Heraldry Selection:** Adds a "Heraldries" tab to the "Crests" selector. This new tab lists all faction heraldries from the game and any installed mods. Clicking a heraldry instantly applies its color scheme to your company.
2. **Color ID Display:** Displays the ID of the selected color and each color swatch, which is helpful for modders creating new `HeraldryDef` files. This is particularly useful because the colors in the selection panel are not sorted in a predictable order.

This makes it much easier to apply a faction's color scheme to your 'Mechs or to quickly find the color IDs you need for your own modding projects.

> [!TIP]
> For non-modders, each faction and unit in BattleTech has its own `HeraldryDef` file that defines its color scheme and emblem (crest). You can find a guide [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=german&id=2638707115) on how to edit them.
