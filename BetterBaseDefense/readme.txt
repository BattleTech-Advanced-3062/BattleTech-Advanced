By Cargo Vroom

Do you think it's neat when you have friendly turrets or allied vehicles?
Do you think Base Defense missions are frustrating?

If you answered yes to either of those questions this mod is for you!

It gives every base defense mission friendly turrets.
They get turned on by a pair of friendly APC that will then also fight by your side.
