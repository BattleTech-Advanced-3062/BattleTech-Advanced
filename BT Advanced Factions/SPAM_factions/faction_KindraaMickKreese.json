	"Description": "Clan Fire Mandrill is divided into various sub-groups called Kindraa, of which Kindraa Mick-Kreese is a lesser specimen. Mick-Kreese has long struggled for resources and had to scrape and claw for everything it has, leading to the Kindraa often regarding other Kindraa with contempt and bitterness. Still, they are Clan warriors and thus are a force to be feared in the Inner Sphere.",
