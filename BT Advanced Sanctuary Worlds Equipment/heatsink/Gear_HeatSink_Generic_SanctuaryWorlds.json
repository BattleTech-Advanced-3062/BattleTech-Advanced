The Sanctuary Worlder's heat sinks are less powerful than the Inner Sphere's double heat sinks (though more powerful than standard heat sinks, a technology that they did retain) though they are similar to Clan double heat sinks in compactness. However, the Sanctuary Worlds developed multiple kinds of heat sinks that all link to the same master kits, giving them flexibility in their cooling options that the Inner Sphere and even the Clans cannot match.",
