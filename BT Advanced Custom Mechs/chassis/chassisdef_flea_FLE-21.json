Armed with a pair of MRM-10s, the FLE-21 has a surprisingly hard punch for a mech its size. The downside is that to carry such weaponry the mech has to sacrifice durability, mounting only the standard 3 tons of armor, though it was upgraded to Ferro-Fibrous. Additionlly the mech carries a fragile XL engine for power. To give it a boost, the Kuritans gave it a MASC system for extra speed.",
