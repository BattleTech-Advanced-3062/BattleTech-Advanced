A direct upgrade of the 3D model, the 5D's engine was replaced with a XL Engine. The 5D's primary weapons were two ER PPCs, supported by a Large Pulse Laser. The medium lasers were replaced with two Medium Pulse Lasers, while a Streak SRM-2 launcher was also added to the left torso with one ton of CASE-protected ammo. The model was protected by fourteen tons of armor and carried sixteen double heat sinks for heat management. It also had a jumping capability of up to 120 meters thanks to four jump jets mounted in its legs.",
