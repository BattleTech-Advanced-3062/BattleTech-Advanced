The -4R was much more akin to the Rifleman in design and was intended for precise long-ranged weapons fire. It replaces the -4G's torso-mounted lasers with twin Large Lasers for extra range and punch. It gains the tonnage to do this by slowing the Quickdraw down to from its 300-rated engine to a more sedate 240-rated one. Otherwise, the -4R is similar to the -4G.",
