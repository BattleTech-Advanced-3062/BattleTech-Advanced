    "Details": "The original Archer prototype built for the Terran Hegemony in 2458 with Primitive Technology. It was slower than the successor ARC-2R variant with a top speed of 54 km/h with the inclusion of a Primitive Engine. Its loadout was somewhat similar, with the frame housing a pair of LRM-20's and 4 tons of ammunition, but only mounted two Medium Lasers, one in each fully-articulated arm. It was protected by 16 tons of Primitive Armor. At the time, it was praised for its reliability and ease of maintenance, although in combat produced far more excess heat than the machine could handle if all weapons were fired - a similar issue carried over to the later Archer.",
