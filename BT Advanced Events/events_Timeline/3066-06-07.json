They piloted BattleMechs of obvious recent construction, as well as Star League-era and even a few Clan OmniMechs.  The unknown aggressors are attacking several periphery Lyran worlds in the Melissia Theater, including a deep strike at the world of Khartoum. \n\nThe only clues to the bandit's identities were the olive drab paint schemes on their 'Mechs, and their focus on archaeological sites of religious or cultural significance, and old Star League locations.  The Quanatir [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMTM],MTM]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreIE],Interstellar Expeditions]] are calling for mercenary reinforcements against what are already called the \"Green Ghosts\", and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LorePSG],Periphery Star Guard]], [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDevilsBrig],Devil's Brigade]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGabhardtsCara],Gabhardt's Carabineers]] are already en-route.",
