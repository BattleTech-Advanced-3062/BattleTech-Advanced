Included in this partnership is effective ownership over several abandoned worlds in the so-called Outworlds Wastes, giving the Ravens a landhold in the Inner Sphere.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

More questionable is the Alliance agreeing to grant the Clan territory since Clans are not known for their pacifism, which the Alliance is renown for. Only time can tell the results of this friendship, especially as Clan Snow Raven has had prior poor interactions with House Kurita and some enmity may linger there.",
