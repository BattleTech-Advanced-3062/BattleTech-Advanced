        "Details": "BLACK MAY DEATH TOLL LOWER THAN EXPECTED”\r\n\n\nSian, Capellan Confederation: Officials from both the Capellan Confederation and the St. Ives Compact have  released simultaneous statements confirming the capture of the last Thuggee terrorists implicated in the Black May nerve gas attacks. Total casualties of the Thuggee attacks are reported to be in the vicinity of 10000, a far cry from the nearly 5 million casualties initially estimated. Although Capellan authorities publicly cooperated with their St. Ives Compact counterparts in apprehending the Thuggee terrorists and halting the attacks, some within the Compact have accused the Capellans of dragging their feet and tacitly allowing the Black May attacks to proceed. The fact that Thuggee terrorists apprehended by the Capellans simply disappear into Maskirovka custody rather than being publicly tried further fuels these accusations.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
