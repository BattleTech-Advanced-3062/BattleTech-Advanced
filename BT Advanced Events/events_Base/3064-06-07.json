On Dustball, the Seventh Falcon Regulars and the Jade Falcon Eyrie Cluster landed, quickly inflicting heavy casualties on the local militia brigade. Meanwhile on Koniz, the mercenary Barber’s Marauder IIs were utterly demolished by nothing more than a mixed force of elementals and the 124th Striker Cluster. Scattered reports from the area indicate that the Marauder IIs were hunted down to a man, with the survivors taken as isorla. Although the full extent of the Jade Falcon incursion is currently unknown, additional reports of Jade Falcon units engaging Lyran forces continue to trickle in.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

Although an important center of economic activity for the Federated Commonwealth, with a bustling tourism and pleasure industry, it is unclear what the typically stoic and reserved Clanners stood to gain by taking the world. Likewise, the strategically unimportant world of Newtown Square fell to a mere trio of Falcon clusters as the battered Fourth Donegal Guards under Leutnant-General Adam Steiner retreated before the meticulous Clanner assault.",
