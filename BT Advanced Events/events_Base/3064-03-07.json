Surprising many, the Snow Raven admiral was reportedly “impressed” by the skill of the Outworlds pilots, and quickly requested a parlay and the opening of a “dialogue” between the Periphery nation and the Clan. Rarely has a Clan used dialogue when arms would suffice, and the opening of relations between the Alliance and Clan Snow Raven could have lasting implications for the stability of the region.",

Using the immense facilities of the Titan Naval Yards, the <i>Guarded Knowledge</i>, <i>Hidden Meaning</i>, <i>Immortal Spirit</i>, and <i>Blake’s Sword</i> were all added to the rapidly growing rolls of the Word of Blake Navy. As the Blakist military build-up continues, observers are left pondering the uses to which these new WarShips may be put. A spokesperson from the Word of Blake issued a statement saying the manufacture and stockpiling of military goods and myriad mercenary contracts are “necessary to ensure the safety and security of the faithful.”",
