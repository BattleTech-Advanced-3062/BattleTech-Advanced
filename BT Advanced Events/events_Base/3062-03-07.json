Where the original Gunslinger Program was formed with the goal of improving SLDF mechwarrior training to match that of Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery duelists, the reinstated Gunslinger Program is specifically designed to give Inner Sphere personnel an edge when fighting Clanners. The FWC Gunslinger Program is open to the citizens of all Star League member states and promises to give enrollees the advanced tactical training needed to take on Clan warriors in one-on-one duels.",

Dubbed the “Rotary Autocannon,” or RAC, the new weapons promise to deliver a rate of fire six times that of a standard Autocannon, and three times that of an Ultra Autocannon. Although technically restricted to Federated Commonwealth forces, it is likely only a matter of time before this technology finds its way across the Inner Sphere.",
