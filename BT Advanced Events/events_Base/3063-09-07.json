Unable to appease the Dominion leadership by disavowing the Avengers as traitors, Coordinator Kurita was forced to redeploy DCMS units throughout the region to defend against the Ghost Bear invasion. Although following no recognizable strategy, the utter ferocity of the Ghost Bear assault was too much for many DCMS units and a number of worlds quickly fell to the Dominion. \r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

With the Federated Commonwealth in the midst of its own civil war, it is unclear whether the March’s invasion represents a bid for independence for the March worlds or an offering to either Steiner or Davion. In a near mirror image, reports from the Clan Occupation Zones indicate that Clan Hell’s Horses may be mobilizing against their old rivals in the Dominion.",
