	"Details": "Founded 2315, Dissolved 2767. The Terran Hegemony was one of the original great powers of the Inner Sphere and was centered on Terra itself. The Hegemony claimed many of the systems surrounding Terran for itself over the early decades of its existence and quickly grew to dominate the fields of interstellar relations, technological advancement, and military innovation. It was the foundational state for the Star League under Director Ian Cameron and its collapse in the Amaris Civil War was what lead to the Succession Wars as the other Great Houses fought bloody and brutal wars over its remains.",
