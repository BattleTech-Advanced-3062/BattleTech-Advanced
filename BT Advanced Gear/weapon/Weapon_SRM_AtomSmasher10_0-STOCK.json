		"Details": "After his mysterious return to the Inner Sphere, Stefan Amaris the Usurper set out to learn how military technology had advanced in the intervening centuries. When he was shown modern SRM ammo types, including Tandem-Charge ammunition, the Usurper declared that this was merely a good start and directed his scientists to improve upon the design and improve they did. This weapon, dubbed the Atom Smasher/10, is essentially a 10-tube SRM launcher with significantly improved armor piercing and critical damage potential. Unlike lesser SRMs, the Atom Smasher/10 does equal damage to armor and structure and has a reasonably high critical damage chance which means that it shreds through targets with aplomb. Amaris was reportedly pleased with his new tool of destruction and ordered it into service. \n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Uses Atom Smasher Ammo.</color></b>.",
