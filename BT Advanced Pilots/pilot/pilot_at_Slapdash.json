        "Details": "Nobles are born with silver spoons in their mouths. Toni Okoye was born with a wrench. Raised in the Outback of the Federated Suns, she learned quickly that one man’s junk was another man’s treasure. Parts and supply could be hard to find in the wilder parts of the Suns, and so many learned to re-purpose, reuse, and recycle. Toni enjoyed tinkering with all manner of devices, and her family had an oddly rich history in technology. Her grandfather had worked building Nissan 200s for the Enforcer, and her folk took that knowledge with them when they left the more civilized world he’d made a living on after he lost his job due to being more devoted to a bottle than he was to his job. They’d kept all his manuals and notes though, and Toni’s mother and father both took jobs in repair and maintenance once the family re-settled.\r\n\r\nToni learned about ‘Mechs the same way a lot of people in the rougher parts of the Inner Sphere do; she got lucky. The garrison on her world had a chassis in need of an engine, and as it happened, Toni managed to blunder into one, get it working, and install it into the decrepit Enforcer 3R, giving the ‘Mech it’s first hum of life in a hundred years. A thankful local government let her practice and train in it once they managed to hire a Dispossessed Mechwarrior to both man the machine and teach the eager young woman. The idea of being a real Mechwarrior appealed to the woman, and as she aged, being stuck on the “dust ball” as she called it started to sit wrong with her. It didn’t help that the Mechwarrior she’d learned from filled her head with stories of battles and victory, and it wasn’t long before she’d set upon the path to marketing herself to any Mercenary company that wanted a double-duty Tech and pilot. Two-for-one’s a pretty good deal, after all, and the budget-conscious might appreciate an extra hand in the Mechbay. However, her techniques and training often leave something to be desired in the realm of aesthetics, and it’s not uncommon for the Chief Tech to wonder where all the scrap went to and why the leg of the unit’s Orion looks like it lost a fight with a junkyard.",
