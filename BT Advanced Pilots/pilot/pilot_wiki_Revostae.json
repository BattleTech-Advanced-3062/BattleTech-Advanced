However, during Operation BULLDOG he encountered a number of mercenaries who proved both skilled and honorable. They also had a degree of freedom on the battlefield that he had always wished for. At the next possible opportunity he decided to leave the DCMS and pursue a mercenary career. The money has always been secondary to him, what he seeks is to use his tactics and skills freely on the battlefield and reach his peak potential.",
