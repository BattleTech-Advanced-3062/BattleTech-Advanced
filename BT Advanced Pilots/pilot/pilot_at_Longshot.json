        "Details": "Born and raised on Larsha, one of the hubs of Periphery activity in the Confederation, Yue Doyle was familiar with the military life from the start of her life. Her father served in the 5th Confederation Reserve Cavalry, piloting a Locust 1M. All through her youth, she listened to his stories about training and chasing off pirates. From her mother she acquired an appreciation and love for archery; the precision and concentration appealing to her focused nature.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned 18, she enrolled in the Duchy Regional Training Center on Zanzibar so she could fight beside her father in the 5th Reserve Cav. Just before she graduated, she heard news that he’d been killed during a raid by unmarked forces originating from Taurian space. That same week, she received an official dispatch assigning her to the 5th back on Larsha, placing her in her father’s old company. When she arrived, she was assigned to his Locust, but throughout her career she proved to be a far better pilot, and was soon promoted to a larger machine, but she preferred to remain in her father’s ‘Mech. Thrice she denied promotion, preferring the smaller machine and her role as rapid response fire support, and when her term of service came up for renewal, she opted out, instead choosing to seek employment outside the Confederation, wanting to hunt down the unknown forces that had taken her father’s life and exact revenge.",
