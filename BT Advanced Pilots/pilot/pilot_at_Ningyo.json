        "Details": "Not every world is a barren wasteland or a Terra-like paradise. Some of them have cities built on cliffs on the tiny points of land surrounded by swathes of vast ocean. Some of them don’t even have that, and residents live in sea colonies, never knowing what land, or trees, or even sometimes the sky looks like on a clear day because of all the storms. Kalida Hossein grew up on such a world, called Athenry, and when she came of age she joined the PDF like a lot of misplaced youth, hoping to be more like the mercenaries of the Blue Star Irregulars; a Merc group that had once conquered the world for House Steiner, and came to be very well-liked by the populace before being driven from the planet less than a year later.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, living on an ocean-bound planet means unless a Great House decides to use you as a staging ground for further conquest, you aren’t likely to experience much in the way of excitement, as raiding sea bases or cliff towns is sort of logistically difficult, and sulfurous sea water isn’t worth stealing for pirates living on arid hellholes unless they have a desalinization plant on hand. Kalida didn’t enjoy her tenure in the PDF, mainly because while the gentle rocking of the sea colonies was soothing, the bucking and lilting of the defense craft patrolling the surface made her realize quite quickly that she was prone to seasickness. So  she did her best to get transferred to repair and refurbishing detail, piloting watertight IndustrialMechs tasked with welding new plates onto weakened parts of the colony. That was at least more interesting, even if it didn’t help her seasickness at all.\r\n\r\nAfter her tenure in the PDF was up, she had enough money saved to transfer off-world, wanting nothing more than to get away from all that water. Unfortunately, her qualifications meant she was most suited to signing on with a Merc outfit, and it was then she found out that neurohelmets trigger her seasickness just like the patrol ships she served on used to. She makes due, but any outfit that keeps her on better keep extra dimenhydrinate on hand just in case.",
