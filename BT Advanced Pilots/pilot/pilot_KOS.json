		"Details": "He's a quiet regular at salvage and junk yards, often seen wandering rows of rusted metal and forgotten machines.  With a sharp eye for value, he has a knack for salvaging parts others overlook, turning scraps into something useful again.  Beyond that talent, and a card carrying Magistocracy, little is known about him --- where he comes from, what he's building, or why he prefers to stay in the background remains a mystery.\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>SPECIAL PASSIVE ABILITY: INCREASES YOUR SALVAGE PICKS BUT COSTS 150,000 CBILLS MORE IN MONTHLY UPKEEP</color></b>",
