Of course, he was finally defeated and his 'Mech taken from him but the concept of the Insane God stuck with the 'Mech ever after. Insane God mounts a quartet of advanced lasers: two Dissolving Medium Pulses, a Piercing Small Pulse, and a Static ER Small. A 160-rated XL engine plus MASC guarantees Insane God has plenty of speed to toy with its enemies. The original pilot may be gone but the reputation lives on.",
