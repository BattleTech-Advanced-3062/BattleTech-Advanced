IS Melee Rules:
Base Damage: tonnage
has two lower actuator: +5 dmg
has two hand actuator: +5 dmg
if only one arm with a lower and one arm with a hand: +5 dmg
if only one arm with a lower and nothing else on the other: no bonus
if only one arm with a hand and nothing else on the other: +5 dmg

Sum together for total dmg.
Stab Damage: melee/3, round down to nearest 5

DFA: same as total for melee
DFA stab: same as total stab for melee
DFA automatically doubles whatever that number is.

Determine this number once for the base variant of a chassis and just apply it to each version of the chassis. We're not getting picky about "well this variant has a lower arm but this one doesn't", that's more granularity than is necessary.
